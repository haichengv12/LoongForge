"""LingbotVLA-V2 ModelConfig — model-structure parameters (YAML ``model:`` section).

This frozen dataclass is the single source of truth for the model structure and
model-side training switches of the lingbot_vla_v2 VLA model (Qwen3-VL-4B VLM +
Token-MoE action expert + depth/video alignment heads).

Usage rules (per LoongForge-VLA spec):
1. Always read fields via direct attribute access: ``model_cfg.action_dim``.
2. Never use ``getattr(cfg, "x", default)`` / ``cfg.get(...)`` in business code.
3. To add/change a model-structure parameter, edit only this dataclass.

The vendored benchmark network is driven by a ``LingbotVLAV2Config`` (a
``PretrainedConfig`` subclass). ``build_internal_config()`` translates this
typed dataclass into that internal config so the two never diverge.
