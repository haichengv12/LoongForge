"""Adapter (seam) between LoongForge and the upstream lingbot-vla-v2 stack.

Background
----------
The lingbot-vla-v2 network is consumed from a pinned third-party ``lingbotvla``
package (delivered as an editable / source install of a fixed commit). This
module is the single seam that imports the upstream symbols and layers
LoongForge's own additions on top of them, without editing upstream source.

Every public ``resolve_*`` function returns one upstream symbol for a category:

* model body / config / loader / HF patches;
* frozen depth / video vision teachers;
* dataset builder and data collator.

LoongForge-specific behaviour is added at two layers, never by patching upstream
source: runtime seams installed here (see the ``_apply_lingbot_*`` shims) and
components under :mod:`loongforge.embodied.model.lingbot_vla_v2`.

Lazy-import contract
--------------------
The external ``lingbotvla`` package and ``torch`` / ``transformers`` are imported
**inside** functions, not at module top level, so importing this module is cheap
and does not require the heavy stack to be present until a symbol is resolved.

Transformers 5.x compatibility
------------------------------
The upstream ``models_common`` loader references symbols that Transformers 5.x
removed / relocated:

* ``transformers.AutoModelForVision2Seq`` -> replaced by
  ``transformers.AutoModelForImageTextToText``;
* ``transformers.modeling_utils.no_init_weights`` -> moved to
  ``transformers.initialization.no_init_weights``.

:func:`_ensure_transformers5_compat` re-exposes the old names on the installed
``transformers`` before any upstream import runs, so the compat shim lives here
in the adapter rather than being scattered across call sites. It is a no-op on
Transformers 4.x.

    at module level (``_flex_attention_compiled = torch.compile(flex_attention,
    dynamic=False)``, selected via ``_FLEX_COMPILE`` / ``set_flex_compile``), because
    the *eager* op materializes the ``[B, H, Q, KV]`` scores and its host time scales
    with shape (measured B=10/H=32/d=128: 8.8 / 30.7 / 115.5 ms per call at seq
    1024 / 2048 / 4096). Upstream ships the same file with the ``@torch.compile``
    decorator **commented out** and calls the eager op directly from
    ``flex_attention_with_block_mask`` / ``flex_attention_forward``, so the upstream
    model runs the slow eager attention path and is markedly slower per step than the
    vendored copy.

    We rebind the upstream module's ``flex_attention`` global to the compiled op,
    mirroring vendored exactly, gated by the same ``model.flex_compile`` flag. Both
    call sites read the module global, so this covers both paths. torch.compile is
    numerically equivalent to the eager op (vendored already relies on this for
    parity), so this narrows the vendored/upstream gap rather than widening it. No
